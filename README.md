# Important Notes For openbox 

- Fonts needed : any nerdfont (JetbrainsMono Nerd Font is what I use) and material design icon font

- I use [ST](https://github.com/siduck/st) terminal.
- [neovim config](https://github.com/NvChad/nvchad).

- Edit tint2 config by tint2conf and you should change some values in the tint2 script files accordingly to your wifi/battery adapter name.
- the gtk theme has the openbox theme , if  you use a different gtk theme then just move the openbox-3 dir from the forest gtk theme to your gtk theme!u
